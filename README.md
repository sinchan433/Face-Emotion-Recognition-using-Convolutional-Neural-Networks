# Face-Emotion-Recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Built and trained a CNN model with FER-2013 dataset of 35+ grayscale images of 48x48 pixels for improved emotion recognition in human-computer interaction. Utilized convolution, max-pooling, dense layers, with Adam optimizer and data augmentation for model training.
